Objective of the Game:
You will be participating in a simple decision-making game. The goal is to select a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that you believe is closest to a target value. The target value is defined as 70% of the average of all chosen numbers.

Your task is to think strategically about the choices others might make and choose your number accordingly.

Rules:
1. Each participant must choose a single number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Decimal numbers (e.g., 25.5) are allowed.
2. After all participants have chosen, the average of all chosen numbers will be calculated.
3. The target value will then be calculated as 70% of this average.
4. The winner is the participant whose chosen number is closest to the target value.
   - In case of a tie (two or more participants are equally close), the prize will be split equally among the tied participants.

Think carefully about your choice, as it depends not only on your reasoning but also on the decisions of others.
