class AgentMind:

    Represents the decision-making and internal logic of an Agent.

    This class handles:
    - Autoformalizing game rules and strategies.
    - Perceiving and processing game history.
    - Revising internal state or strategies based on new information.
    - Determining the agent's actions during gameplay.

    Attributes:
        solver (Solver): The solver instance used for game-related logic and validation.
        autoformalizer (Optional[Autoformalizer]): The autoformalizer used for formalizing rules and strategies.
