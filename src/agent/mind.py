class Mind:
	"""
    Represents the decision-making and internal logic of an Agent.

    The agent:
    1. Acts, by selecting a move in a given round.
    2. Perceives the opponent move and adds it to the memory.
    3. Revises by calculating the payoff based on all players' moves in the given round, and updates the last opponent
    move in the solver, which may influence the strategy in the next round.

    Attributes:
        agent (Agent): The agent instance to manage the decision-making and memory.
