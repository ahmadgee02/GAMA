The prisoner's dilemma game, having the following verbal description:

"You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a move. Your payoff depends on both moves. If you both pick C, you each get $3. If you choose C while they choose D, you get $1, and they get $4. Similarly, if you pick D while they pick C, you get $4, and they get $1. If you both pick D, you each earn $2. The game has only one round."

can be specified as follows:

/* Game specific predicates for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) */

% Payoff matrix for PD
payoff('D', 'D', 2, 2).
payoff('C', 'D', 1, 4).
payoff('D', 'C', 4, 1).
payoff('C', 'C', 3, 3).
% Initial state
initial(s0).
% What holds initially: who is a player, their role, and whether they can play.
initially(player(p1), s0).
initially(player(p2), s0).
initially(role(p1,row), s0).
initially(role(p2,col), s0).
initially(control(p1), s0).
initially(control(p2), s0).
initially(default_move(_, 'C'), s0).
% When a state is final: no need to check content as it generated by game/2,
% implying it is a legal state.
final(do(move(_P2, _M2), do(move(_P1, _M1), S))):-initial(S).
% A legal move is a possible move where the player has control (is its turn).
legal(move(P, M), S):- possible(move(P, M), S), holds(control(P), S).
% What is possible for a player to choose
possible(move(P,'D'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
possible(move(P,'C'), S):- holds(player(P), S).
% Moves that are opposite to each other.
opposite_move('C', 'D').
opposite_move('D', 'C').
% The effects of a move: if P has chosen M, then in the next state this
% is what they did.
effect(did(P, M), move(P, M), _S).
% The effects of a move: once a move is made, the player looses control, i.e.
% cannot move anymore.
abnormal(control(P), move(P, _M), _S).
% What holds finally: the outcome with players, Moves, and Utilities.
finally(outcome(P1,M1,U1,P2,M2,U2), S):-
    final(S),
    holds(role(P1, row), S),
    holds(did(P1, M1), S),
    holds(role(P2, col), S),
    holds(did(P2, M2), S),
    payoff(M1, M2, U1, U2).
% Goals achieved by the players.
finally(goal(P1, U1), S):-
    finally(outcome(P1,_,U1,_,_,_), S).
finally(goal(P2, U2), S):-
    finally(outcome(_,_,_,P2,_,U2), S).
